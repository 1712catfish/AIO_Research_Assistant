    "Hey everyone, welcome to this notebook where we're diving into something super cool: building an all-in-one research chatbot using the power of the Gemma Large Language Model! 🚀\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the game plan:\n",
    "\n",
    "- First up, Section 1: We're kicking things off with a research paper query engine. Imagine being able to find any research paper with just a simple chat. Sounds handy, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Moving on to Section 2: We'll spice things up with a graph paper relationship engine. This is all about connecting the dots between different papers and seeing the bigger picture.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Section 3: We'll add a basic data science assistant to our toolkit. This chatbot will help with all those tricky data questions, from stats to machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Section 4 is for the coders: We're building an AI code assistant that's going to be like your coding sidekick, helping you solve problems and understand complex codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- And for the grand finale, Section 5: We're bringing it all together with a combination module. This is where we make sure everything works in harmony, giving you a powerhouse tool for any research or coding project.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, let's roll up our sleeves and jump into this exciting project. An overview of this project is below: 🌟"

    "\n",
    "When you ask the chatbot something, it uses these embeddings to look through the abstracts and find papers that really match what you're looking for, not just by keywords, but by the actual ideas and concepts you're interested in. This is more about understanding the meaning of your question and finding papers that really match.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll go through everything: picking the right papers from arXiv, getting the abstracts ready, and choosing a way to turn these abstracts into embeddings. Then, we'll set up a smart search that can quickly find the best matches when you ask a question."

      " In many applications of computer graphics, art and design, it is desirablefor a user to provide intuitive non-image input, such as text, sketch, stroke,graph or layout, and have a computer system automatically generatephoto-realistic images that adhere to the input content. While classic worksthat allow such automatic image content generation have followed a framework ofimage retrieval and composition, recent advances in deep generative models suchas generative adversarial networks (GANs), variational autoencoders (VAEs), andflow-based methods have enabled more powerful and versatile image generationtasks. This paper reviews recent works for image synthesis given intuitive userinput, covering advances in input versatility, image generation methodology,benchmark datasets, and evaluation metrics. This motivates new perspectives oninput representation and interactivity, cross pollination between major imagegeneration paradigms, and evaluation and comparison of generation methods.\n",

However, theintersection of these two, i.e., generating paintings from a given caption, isa relatively unexplored area with little data available. In this paper, we haveexplored two distinct strategies and have integrated them together. Firststrategy is to generate photorealistic images and then apply style transfer andthe second strategy is to train an image generation model on real images withcaptions and then fine-tune it on captioned paintings later. These two modelsare evaluated using different metrics as well as a user study is conducted toget human feedback on the produced results.\n",

In this paper, wepropose a method that utilizes artificial intelligence models for thematiccreativity, followed by a classification modeling of the actual paintingprocess. The method involves converting all visual elements into quantifiabledata structures before creating images.

Exemplars of image synthesis from textor other images, these networks have shown remarkable improvements overconventional methods in terms of performance. Trained on the adversarialtraining philosophy, these networks aim to estimate the potential distributionfrom the real data and then use this as input to generate the synthetic data.Based on this fundamental principle, several frameworks can be generated thatare paragon implementations in several real-life applications such as artsynthesis, generation of high resolution outputs and synthesis of images fromhuman drawn sketches, to name a few. While theoretically GANs present betterresults and prove to be an improvement over conventional methods in manyfactors, the implementation of these frameworks for dedicated applicationsremains a challenge. This study explores and presents a taxonomy of theseframeworks and their use in various image to image synthesis and text to imagesynthesis applications. The basic GANs, as well as a variety of different nicheframeworks, are critically analyzed. The advantages of GANs for imagegeneration over conventional methods as well their disadvantages amongst otherframeworks are presented. The future applications of GANs in industries such ashealthcare, art and entertainment are also discussed.\n",

We provide a breakdown of text-to-image generation into variousflavors of image-from-text methods, video-from-text methods, image editing,self-supervised and graph-based approaches. In this discussion, we focus onresearch papers published at 8 leading machine learning conferences in theyears 2016-2022, also incorporating a number of relevant papers not matchingthe outlined search criteria. The conducted review suggests a significantincrease in the number of papers published in the area and highlights researchgaps and potential lines of investigation.

Online communitiesaround text-to-image generation and AI generated art have quickly emerged. Thispaper identifies six types of prompt modifiers used by practitioners in theonline community based on a 3-month ethnographic study. The novel taxonomy ofprompt modifiers provides researchers a conceptual starting point forinvestigating the practice of text-to-image generation, but may also helppractitioners of AI generated art improve their images.

Nevertheless, as progress isachieved, the complexity of these methodologies increases, consequentlyintensifying the comprehension barrier between individuals within the field andthose external to it. In an endeavor to mitigate this disparity, we propose a streamlined approachfor text-to-image generation, which encompasses both the training paradigm andthe sampling process. Despite its remarkable simplicity, our method yieldsaesthetically pleasing images with few sampling iterations, allows forintriguing ways for conditioning the model, and imparts advantages absent instate-of-the-art techniques. To demonstrate the efficacy of this approach inachieving outcomes comparable to existing works, we have trained a one-billionparameter text-conditional model, which we refer to as \"Paella\".

    "In this section, we dive into constructing a knowledge graph about the relationships of papers. This graph could be used for interactive visualization, searching relationships between papers (e.g. How is paper A related to paper B), or search for a specific relationship in a paper (e.g. What are works that paper A based on?). The steps of constructing this knowledge graph are:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Step 1: arXiv Data Extraction: The process starts with academic papers from the arXiv database, which undergo OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and PDF parsing, which organizes the content into structured data such as the title, abstract, sections, and references of the papers. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Step 2: Text Splitter: The text in each section is then processed by a Text Splitter, which split the paper section into smaller chunks, which could be easier for LLMs to process.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Step 3 GPT-3.5 Processing: Gemma couldn't generate the knowledge graph out-of-the-box. So we need knowledge distillation from a bigger model, which I choose GPT-3.5. The structured data is passed to GPT-3.5 to extract citation relationships, such as \"Data Source\", \"Extension\", or \"Theoretical Foundation\", etc. Each relationship is paired with a dense explanation. I extracted a total of ~300 papers, which cost around 4$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Step 4 Training Gemma - 7B: The distilled knowledge data are then used to train Gemma-7b. Then I use this model to generate citation relationships for as many papers as I can. In total, I extracted 7k papers, with around 150K triplets! Crazy!!\n",
    "\n",
    "- Step 5 Graph Store: Finally, a Graph Store is created containing 7K papers and 586K triplets. This could then be used for searching relationships or visualization.\n"

However, they can only detect the attacks they have already known, not to mention the extra training for classifying the given attacked samples (Aldahdooh et al., 2022).

      "a survey on video diffusion models\n",
      " The recent wave of AI-generated content (AIGC) has witnessed substantialsuccess in computer vision, with the diffusion model playing a crucial role inthis achievement. Due to their impressive generative capabilities, diffusionmodels are gradually superseding methods based on GANs and auto-regressiveTransformers, demonstrating exceptional performance not only in imagegeneration and editing, but also in the realm of video-related research.However, existing surveys mainly focus on diffusion models in the context ofimage generation, with few up-to-date reviews on their application in the videodomain. To address this gap, this paper presents a comprehensive review ofvideo diffusion models in the AIGC era. Specifically, we begin with a conciseintroduction to the fundamentals and evolution of diffusion models.Subsequently, we present an overview of research on diffusion models in thevideo domain, categorizing the work into three key areas: video generation,video editing, and other video understanding tasks. We conduct a thoroughreview of the literature in these three key areas, including furthercategorization and practical contributions in the field. Finally, we discussthe challenges faced by research in this domain and outline potential futuredevelopmental trends. A comprehensive list of video diffusion models studied inthis survey is available athttps://github.com/ChenHsing/Awesome-Video-Diffusion-Models.\n",

      "frame by familiar frame: understanding replication in video diffusion models\n",
      " Building on the momentum of image generation diffusion models, there is anincreasing interest in video-based diffusion models. However, video generationposes greater challenges due to its higher-dimensional nature, the scarcity oftraining data, and the complex spatiotemporal relationships involved. Imagegeneration models, due to their extensive data requirements, have alreadystrained computational resources to their limits. There have been instances ofthese models reproducing elements from the training samples, leading toconcerns and even legal disputes over sample replication. Video diffusionmodels, which operate with even more constrained datasets and are tasked withgenerating both spatial and temporal content, may be more prone to replicatingsamples from their training sets. Compounding the issue, these models are oftenevaluated using metrics that inadvertently reward replication. In our paper, wepresent a systematic investigation into the phenomenon of sample replication invideo diffusion models. We scrutinize various recent diffusion models for videosynthesis, assessing their tendency to replicate spatial and temporal contentin both unconditional and conditional generation scenarios. Our studyidentifies strategies that are less likely to lead to replication. Furthermore,we propose new evaluation strategies that take replication into account,offering a more accurate measure of a model's ability to generate the originalcontent.\n",

      "efficient video diffusion models via content-frame motion-latent decomposition\n",
      " Video diffusion models have recently made great progress in generationquality, but are still limited by the high memory and computationalrequirements. This is because current video diffusion models often attempt toprocess high-dimensional videos directly. To tackle this issue, we proposecontent-motion latent diffusion model (CMD), a novel efficient extension ofpretrained image diffusion models for video generation. Specifically, wepropose an autoencoder that succinctly encodes a video as a combination of acontent frame (like an image) and a low-dimensional motion latentrepresentation. The former represents the common content, and the latterrepresents the underlying motion in the video, respectively. We generate thecontent frame by fine-tuning a pretrained image diffusion model, and wegenerate the motion latent representation by training a new lightweightdiffusion model. A key innovation here is the design of a compact latent spacethat can directly utilizes a pretrained image diffusion model, which has notbeen done in previous latent video diffusion models. This leads to considerablybetter quality generation and reduced computational costs. For instance, CMDcan sample a video 7.7$\\times$ faster than prior approaches by generating avideo of 512$\\times$1024 resolution and length 16 in 3.1 seconds. Moreover, CMDachieves an FVD score of 212.7 on WebVid-10M, 27.3% better than the previousstate-of-the-art of 292.4.\n",

      "stable video diffusion: scaling latent video diffusion models to large datasets\n",
      " We present Stable Video Diffusion - a latent video diffusion model forhigh-resolution, state-of-the-art text-to-video and image-to-video generation.Recently, latent diffusion models trained for 2D image synthesis have beenturned into generative video models by inserting temporal layers and finetuningthem on small, high-quality video datasets. However, training methods in theliterature vary widely, and the field has yet to agree on a unified strategyfor curating video data. In this paper, we identify and evaluate threedifferent stages for successful training of video LDMs: text-to-imagepretraining, video pretraining, and high-quality video finetuning. Furthermore,we demonstrate the necessity of a well-curated pretraining dataset forgenerating high-quality videos and present a systematic curation process totrain a strong base model, including captioning and filtering strategies. Wethen explore the impact of finetuning our base model on high-quality data andtrain a text-to-video model that is competitive with closed-source videogeneration. We also show that our base model provides a powerful motionrepresentation for downstream tasks such as image-to-video generation andadaptability to camera motion-specific LoRA modules. Finally, we demonstratethat our model provides a strong multi-view 3D-prior and can serve as a base tofinetune a multi-view diffusion model that jointly generates multiple views ofobjects in a feedforward fashion, outperforming image-based methods at afraction of their compute budget.

      "preserve your own correlation: a noise prior for video diffusion models\n",
      " Despite tremendous progress in generating high-quality images using diffusionmodels, synthesizing a sequence of animated frames that are both photorealisticand temporally coherent is still in its infancy. While off-the-shelfbillion-scale datasets for image generation are available, collecting similarvideo data of the same scale is still challenging. Also, training a videodiffusion model is computationally much more expensive than its imagecounterpart. In this work, we explore finetuning a pretrained image diffusionmodel with video data as a practical solution for the video synthesis task. Wefind that naively extending the image noise prior to video noise prior in videodiffusion leads to sub-optimal performance. Our carefully designed video noiseprior leads to substantially better performance. Extensive experimentalvalidation shows that our model, Preserve Your Own Correlation (PYoCo), attainsSOTA zero-shot text-to-video results on the UCF-101 and MSR-VTT benchmarks. Italso achieves SOTA video generation quality on the small-scale UCF-101benchmark with a $10\\times$ smaller model using significantly less computationthan the prior art.\n",

      "diffusion models: a comprehensive survey of methods and applications\n",
      " Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful new family of deep generativemodels with record-breaking performance in many applications, including imagesynthesis, video generation, and molecule design. In this survey, we provide anoverview of the rapidly expanding body of work on diffusion models,categorizing the research into three key areas: efficient sampling, improvedlikelihood estimation, and handling data with special structures. We alsodiscuss the potential for combining diffusion models with other generativemodels for enhanced results. We further review the wide-ranging applications ofdiffusion models in fields spanning from computer vision, natural languagegeneration, temporal data modeling, to interdisciplinary applications in otherscientific disciplines. This survey aims to provide a contextualized, in-depthlook at the state of diffusion models, identifying the key areas of focus andpointing to potential areas for further exploration.

      "diffusion probabilistic modeling for video generation\n",
      " Denoising diffusion probabilistic models are a promising new class ofgenerative models that mark a milestone in high-quality image generation. Thispaper showcases their ability to sequentially generate video, surpassing priormethods in perceptual and probabilistic forecasting metrics. We propose anautoregressive, end-to-end optimized video diffusion model inspired by recentadvances in neural video compression. The model successively generates futureframes by correcting a deterministic next-frame prediction using a stochasticresidual generated by an inverse diffusion process. We compare this approachagainst five baselines on four datasets involving natural and simulation-basedvideos. We find significant improvements in terms of perceptual quality for alldatasets. Furthermore, by introducing a scalable version of the ContinuousRanked Probability Score (CRPS) applicable to video, we show that our modelalso outperforms existing approaches in their probabilistic frame forecastingability.\n",

      "diffusion models for time series applications: a survey\n",
      " Diffusion models, a family of generative models based on deep learning, havebecome increasingly prominent in cutting-edge machine learning research. With adistinguished performance in generating samples that resemble the observeddata, diffusion models are widely used in image, video, and text synthesisnowadays. In recent years, the concept of diffusion has been extended to timeseries applications, and many powerful models have been developed. Consideringthe deficiency of a methodical summary and discourse on these models, weprovide this survey as an elementary resource for new researchers in this areaand also an inspiration to motivate future research. For better understanding,we include an introduction about the basics of diffusion models. Except forthis, we primarily focus on diffusion-based methods for time seriesforecasting, imputation, and generation, and present them respectively in threeindividual sections. We also compare different methods for the same applicationand highlight their connections if applicable. Lastly, we conclude the commonlimitation of diffusion-based methods and highlight potential future researchdirections.\n",

      "video diffusion models\n",
      " Generating temporally coherent high fidelity video is an important milestonein generative modeling research. We make progress towards this milestone byproposing a diffusion model for video generation that shows very promisinginitial results. Our model is a natural extension of the standard imagediffusion architecture, and it enables jointly training from image and videodata, which we find to reduce the variance of minibatch gradients and speed upoptimization. To generate long and higher resolution videos we introduce a newconditional sampling technique for spatial and temporal video extension thatperforms better than previously proposed methods. We present the first resultson a large text-conditioned video generation task, as well as state-of-the-artresults on established benchmarks for video prediction and unconditional videogeneration.

      "medm: mediating image diffusion models for video-to-video translation with temporal correspondence guidance\n",
      " This study introduces an efficient and effective method, MeDM, that utilizespre-trained image Diffusion Models for video-to-video translation withconsistent temporal flow. The proposed framework can render videos from sceneposition information, such as a normal G-buffer, or perform text-guided editingon videos captured in real-world scenarios. We employ explicit optical flows toconstruct a practical coding that enforces physical constraints on generatedframes and mediates independent frame-wise scores. By leveraging this coding,maintaining temporal consistency in the generated videos can be framed as anoptimization problem with a closed-form solution. To ensure compatibility withStable Diffusion, we also suggest a workaround for modifying observation-spacescores in latent Diffusion Models. Notably, MeDM does not require fine-tuningor test-time optimization of the Diffusion Models. Through extensivequalitative, quantitative, and subjective experiments on various benchmarks,the study demonstrates the effectiveness and superiority of the proposedapproach.

      "Linear predictor function : In statistics and in machine learning, a linear predictor function is a linear function (linear combination) of a set of coefficients and explanatory variables (independent variables), whose value is used to predict the outcome of a dependent variable. This sort of function usually comes in linear regression, where the coefficients are called regression coefficients. However, they also occur in various types of linear classifiers (e.g. logistic regression, perceptrons, support vector machines, and linear discriminant analysis), as well as in various other models, such as principal component analysis and factor analysis. In many of these models, the coefficients are referred to as \"weights\".\n",

      "Partial least squares regression : Partial least squares regression (PLS regression) is a statistical method that bears some relation to principal components regression; instead of finding hyperplanes of maximum variance between the response and independent variables, it finds a linear regression model by projecting the predicted variables and the observable variables to a new space. Because both the X and Y data are projected to new spaces, the PLS family of methods are known as bilinear factor models. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) is a variant used when the Y is categorical. PLS is used to find the fundamental relations between 2 matrices (X and Y), i.e. a latent variable approach to modeling the covariance structures in these two spaces. A PLS model will try to find the multidimensional direction in the X space that explains the maximum multidimensional variance direction in the Y space. PLS regression is particularly suited when the matrix of predictors has more variables than observations, and when there is multicollinearity among X values. By contrast, standard regression will fail in these cases (unless it is regularized). Partial least squares was introduced by the Swedish statistician Herman O. A. Wold, who then developed it with his son, Svante Wold. An alternative term for PLS is projection to latent structures, but the term partial least squares is still dominant in many areas. Although the original applications were in the social sciences, PLS regression is today most widely used in chemometrics and related areas. It is also used in bioinformatics, sensometrics, neuroscience, and anthropology.\n",

      "Ecological regression : Ecological regression is a statistical technique which runs regression on aggregates, often used in political science and history to estimate group voting behavior from aggregate data.For example, if counties have a known Democratic vote (in percentage) D, and a known percentage of Catholics, C, then running a linear regression of dependent variable D against independent variable C will give D = a + bC. If the regression gives D = .22 + .45C for example, then the estimated Catholic vote (C = 1) is 67% Democratic and the non-Catholic vote (C = 0) is 22% Democratic. The technique has been often used in litigation brought under the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to see how blacks and whites voted.\n",
